Quick! 

A new project has come to your door, and the task seems really complicated. 

Not only that, but it also seems business requirements will likely change in 
the future. 

This is what we know so far: 

Your company is about to launch digital chairs, digital chairs have all the 
characteristics of normal chairs, except for the fact that they are digital (duh!)

You will be launching (for now) just one model.

Remember a chair has: 

- A material
- At least 3 legs (or it could not stand)
- At least one color 

This is your boilerplate Dockerfile, which includes a Makefile to quickly run 
your tests and get inside the container to debug 

This workshop will also work locally, but working on a docker container will give 
us a more real-scenario idea of how to do this in a professional environment

If you want to skip the local build you can use the image `joseangelsc/tdd_workshop`
from dockerhub
