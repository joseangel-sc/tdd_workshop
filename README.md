Now the business has a new requirement, 

A chair needs the possibility: 

If requested, a chair model will be able to adapt between 1, 2 or 3 people

Meaning, that you can create a chair, but it is expected that if you call a 
`set_capacity` method, the chair will increase or decrease the number of people 
that can be sat there.. 

Unless the color of the chair is blue, then, it can only have 1 person 

So, in this branch, go on and create 1st the test for this problem
