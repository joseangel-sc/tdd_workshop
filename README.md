Quick! 

A new project has come to your door, and the task seems really complicated. 

Not only that, but it also seems business requirements will likely change in 
the future. 

This is what we know so far: 

You're company is about to launch digital chairs, digital chairs have all the 
characteristics of normal chairs, except for the fact that they are digital (duh!)

You will be launching (for now) just one model.

Remember a chair has: 

- A material
- At least 3 legs (or it could not stand)
- At least one color 

This is your boilerplate Dockerfile, which includes a Makefile to quickly run 
your tests and get inside the container to debug
